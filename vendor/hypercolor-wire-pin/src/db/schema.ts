 * Schema v4 — account-scoped Encrypted Links, opaque AEAD snapshots, stream

 * and is not rewritten; this migration rebuilds the v3 tables.
 *
 * Combined v4 data policy (do not carry unreachable or native-incompatible
 * rows):
 * - Receivers are NOT copied. v3 `secret_ref` is the JS keychain service
 *   name (`hypercolor-link-receiver-secret`), not a native-minted alias.
 *   Copying it into `receiver_alias` makes `getReceiverPublicKey` reject
 *   forever with no delete path. The table is created empty; the next
 *   `enable()` / `provisionReceiver` mints a real native alias (and
 *   self-heals if a stale row is ever present).
 * - Links, messages, and cursors are copied ONLY when a v3 receiver row
 *   exists with a non-empty `owner_pubky`. The previous COALESCE(..., '')
 *   fallback created rows no real-owner query (or `clearAccountData`)
 *   could ever see. With no receiver, those tables are created empty.
 * - Copied v3 `links.snapshot` values are plaintext JS snapshots. Native
 *   AEAD restore rejects them as `protocol`; `handleLinkFailure` wipes
 *   the row and re-handshakes. That is the intended self-heal — we still
 *   copy owned link rows so the wipe/re-handshake runs against a real
 *   owner instead of leaving silent orphans.
 *
 * SENSITIVITY:
 * - The receiver Noise SECRET and homeserver bearer NEVER enter SQLite (or
 *   JS). Rows store only opaque aliases minted by native.
 * - `links.snapshot` is opaque AEAD ciphertext produced natively under a
 *   per-install device key. TypeScript must never parse it.
 * - `link_messages.body` / `raw_json` and `link_stream_items.raw_json` are
 *   plaintext message history, local to this device. Bodies never enter logs.
